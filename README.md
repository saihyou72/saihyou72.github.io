# saihyou.github.io

- Static html for my main URL's landing page
- And bunch of overkill libraries to make coding easier
- Half-butted site design, but hey, it works
- Contains some extent of personal info, not too personal in case that someone bother to track me
- Maybe having some REST backend will be good?
